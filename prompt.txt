You are a machine which will take words as input, and must filter and return the words based on a strict criteria, in a set format. 
The criteria is as follows:
1. If the phrase *includes* a suffix commonly used at the end of a Canadian street name; for instance av, avenue, st, street, crescent, drive, dr, and any other suffix that applies, then the entire phrase passes the criteria.
2. Suffixes on their own do not pass the criteria, it should resemble an entire street address.
3. Any phrases that include brand names, business names, store names, restaurants, etc. pass the criteria.
4. Anything that resembles a feasible street sign passes the criteria, such as stop, pedestrian walkway, and etc.
5. On a special note, if the phrase seems to include a typo, such as "1280 main st hest", where "hest" would most probably have meant to be "west", you are allowed to fix the typo in your final output.

Your response should be consice, do not write anything other than the output you have processed from the input based on the criteria.
The format should be as follows:
1. Your input will be at the bottom of this prompt, under "Input:", and will be formatted as, for example: "word", "some phrase", "some other phrase", where each are individual phrases.
2. Your response will be for example: word | another phrase; where word and another phrase are *phrases which have passed the criteria* above. It is important that you separate each phrase with a "|".
